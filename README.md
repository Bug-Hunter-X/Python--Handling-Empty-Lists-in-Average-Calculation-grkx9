This repository contains example code demonstrating a common error in Python: not handling empty lists when calculating the average.  The `bug.py` file shows the initial flawed code. The improved code in `bugSolution.py` addresses this error by explicitly checking for an empty list and returning 0 in that case. This prevents a `ZeroDivisionError` and ensures the function behaves correctly for all inputs.
